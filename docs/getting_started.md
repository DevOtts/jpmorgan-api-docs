# Getting started

Create an account and learn how to start using our J.P. Morgan Online Payments APIs for your payment processing.

## Before you begin

To explore our APIs and learn how our services work, you'll need the following:

1. A J.P. Morgan Payments developer account to access your personal workspace.
2. A workspace project in the Payments Developer Portal with Online Payments APIs.

Create your J.P. Morgan Payments developer account [here](https://developer.payments.jpmorgan.com/console/login). After you sign in and create your project, you'll be able to retrieve your workspace credentials and begin testing our APIs. For more detailed steps on using the Developer Portal, refer to the developer [quick start](https://developer.payments.jpmorgan.com/docs/quick-start) page.

## Apply for a live client account

After you create a workspace project, you can initiate your client experience on the Developer Portal. Click on the **BECOME A CLIENT** button to request access. Fill out the form and we'll get in touch with you within three business days.

Some things needed before accessing your live account include:

- **Client profile** — We'll collect the business details J.P. Morgan needs prior to partnering with you.

- **Product selection and configuration** — Our sales team will help you choose the features needed for your business.

- **Test client credentials** — Our implementations team will help authenticate you and issue test client credentials.


## Integrate and test

You'll be issued a set of processing credentials to access our APIs. After your integration has been tested and approved, we will assign your production credentials for you to start processing live payments.
